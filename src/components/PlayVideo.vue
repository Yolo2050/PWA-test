Sure, here's the commented version of your PlayVideo.vue file:

This file defines a Vue component that renders a video player. The video source is defined in the videoSrc variable. The handleVideoEnded function is called when the video ends. The onMounted and onBeforeUnmount lifecycle hooks are used to add and remove the 'ended' event listener from the video player when the component is mounted and before it's unmounted, respectively. -->

<template>
  <!-- The video player component -->
  <div>
    <!-- The video HTML5 element. The ref attribute is used to get a reference to this element in the script -->
    <video
      ref="videoPlayer"
      controls
    >
      <!-- The source of the video. The :src directive is used to bind the videoSrc data property to the src attribute -->
      <source
        :src="videoSrc"
        type="video/mp4"
      />
    </video>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
  // Importing necessary functions from Vue
  import { ref, onMounted, onBeforeUnmount } from 'vue'

  // The path to the video file
  const videoSrc = '@/assets/video/a-1_Chant.mp4' // Replace with the path to your MP4 file

  // A reference to the video player element
  const videoPlayer = ref(null)

  // A function that will be called when the video ends
  const handleVideoEnded = () => {
    // Handle video ended event here
    // This function will be called when the video ends
  }

  // The onMounted lifecycle hook. This function will be called when the component is mounted to the DOM
  onMounted(() => {
    // Adding an event listener for the 'ended' event to the video player
    videoPlayer.value.addEventListener('ended', handleVideoEnded)
  })

  // The onBeforeUnmount lifecycle hook. This function will be called just before the component is unmounted from the DOM
  onBeforeUnmount(() => {
    // Removing the event listener for the 'ended' event from the video player
    videoPlayer.value.removeEventListener('ended', handleVideoEnded)
  })
</script>
